# RabbitMQ Signing Keys

This repository contains an alternative download location for the public keys
that can be used to [verify signatures of RabbitMQ release artifacts](https://www.rabbitmq.com/signatures.html)
or verify signatures of the [apt](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html) and [dnf](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html) package mirrors maintained by the RabbitMQ core team.

Please see [Releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/signing-keys/releases).
